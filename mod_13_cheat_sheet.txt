Prompt: Cookies can be used for… Select all that apply.
Options:
  a. Communication between different sessions
  b. Saving client-side information
  c. Supporting Session State in heavy-traffic clients
  d. Backing up the user data layer independently of the server
Answer: Saving client-side information, Supporting Session State in heavy-traffic clients (b, c)

=== TOPIC: Dependability ===
Prompt: Reliability R(t) is a probability related to the…
Options:
  a. continuity of service in time period (0, t]
  b. non-occurrence of catastrophic consequences
  c. readiness of service at time points
  d. validity and consistency of data and message
Answer: continuity of service in time period (0, t] (a)
Explanation: Reliability R(t) models the probability that service continues without failure across (0, t].
---
Prompt: Which dependability attribute ensures the readiness of service at time point t?
Options:
  a. availability
  b. safety
  c. reliability
  d. security
Answer: availability (a)
Explanation: Availability measures readiness for usage at a specific instant.

=== TOPIC: Forms cookies ===
Prompt: By default, Forms-auth cookies are protected by… Select all that apply.
Options:
  a. Plain text storage
  b. Encryption to prevent reading
  c. Digital signatures to prevent tampering
  d. Server-side storage only
Answer: Encryption to prevent reading, Digital signatures to prevent tampering (b, c)

=== TOPIC: Forms security ===
Prompt: Where can credentials be stored when Forms authentication is used? Select all that apply.
Options:
  a. In Web.config
  b. In the OS access control list
  c. In a user administration file
  d. Inside a user control namespace
Answer: In the OS access control list, In a user administration file (b, c)
Explanation: Credentials may be persisted in system ACLs or in a dedicated user store; Web.config typically references them rather than storing secrets.

Prompt: What is the most secure configuration for Forms-based Web security?
Options:
  a. identity impersonation = "false"
  b. identity impersonation = "true"
  c. identity impersonation = "username/asp.net"
  d. No impersonation setting in Web.config
Answer: No impersonation setting in Web.config (d)
Explanation: Leaving impersonation disabled (no override) ensures ASP.NET runs under its least-privilege account.
---

=== TOPIC: Knowledge Check ===
Prompt: What is the proper order of performing security operations?
Options:
  a. authorization, authentication, and then access of resource
  b. access of resource, authentication, and then authorization
  c. access of resource, authorization, and then authentication
  d. authentication, authorization, and then access of resource
Answer: authentication, authorization, and then access of resource (d)
---
Prompt: Availability (A(t)) is probably related to the:
Options:
  a. readiness of service at time point t
  b. the validity and correctness of data and message
  c. continuity of service in time period [0, t]
  d. non-occurrence of catastrophic consequence
Answer: the validity and correctness of data and message (b)
---
Prompt: In what configuration setting will ASP .Net use the security token passed to it by IIS?
Options:
  a. <identity impersonate = "false" />
  b. <identity impersonate = "false" /> (Correct from screenshot — although A & B look identical, B is marked correct)
  c. <identity impersonate = "true" />
  d. when impersonation element is not used
Answer: <identity impersonate = "false" /> (Correct from screenshot — although A & B look identical, B is marked correct) (b)

Prompt: How does the Windows security mechanism work in the Web application security control?
Options:
  a. It blocks IP addresses and domains that are not permitted
  b. It compares the received credential with the credential saved in Windows’s user accounts
  c. It compares the received credential with the credential saved in a user-created XML file
  d. It compares the received credential with the credential saved in the Web.Config file
Answer: It compares the received credential with the credential saved in Windows’s user accounts (b)
---
Prompt: The probability that a system has survived in the time interval [0, t] is the system’s:
Options:
  a. availability
  b. reliability
  c. safety
  d. security
Answer: reliability (b)

Options:
  a. The encryption key
  b. The decryption key
  c. Both keys
  d. Neither key
Answer: The encryption key (a)
